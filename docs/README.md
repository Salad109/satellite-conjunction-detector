# Benchmark Experiments

Each subdirectory is a benchmark experiment with a writeup, CSV results, and plot scripts. Experiments 1-4 sweep one
parameter at a time. Experiment 5 sweeps all three together. Experiments 6-7 cover runtime configuration.
Experiment 8 validates the pipeline against CelesTrak's SOCRATES Plus catalog.
