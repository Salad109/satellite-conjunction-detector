# Interpolation Stride Sweep

The interpolation stride controls how many coarse time steps share a single SGP4 call. At stride=1, every step gets a
real SGP4 propagation. At stride=N, SGP4 is called every N steps and intermediate positions are filled by cubic Hermite
interpolation using position + velocity at each knot point.

## Parameters

Speed gains flatten out around stride=50 as SGP4 time becomes negligible relative to check pairs and grouping. Accuracy
begins to degrade rapidly after stride=85.
